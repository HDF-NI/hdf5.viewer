The koa based browser interface is a reference app for viewing, modifying and looking at h5 content from browsers. Eventually it will provide for editing, charting and performing statistics on h5 file data.  
The interface is now showing images, datasets, text, column tables and string based packet tables. Basic group operations are available with right-click on a node.  Hovering on a group or dataset shows attributes in a tooltip however still looking for 
a good mechanism to add, copy and edit attributes.  Images can be dropped on the main panel after selecting a group and will be stored at the equivalent place in the h5.  Learning how to accomplish more HDFView functionality in browser style.  
Experimenting with https://ethercalc.net/ as an editor; there is an upper limit to practical data going from h5 into a spreadsheet and other mechanism may need to be provided.  It has some charting yet that may need addressed with a d3 or threejs approach.

Testing addons for custom views/editing or multiviews of the same data.  Implementation of charting based on d3 working for tables. Next need to work on selection/patterns for which tables to map to which custom view.
